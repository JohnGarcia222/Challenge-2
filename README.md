# Challenge 2
--------------
Initial change made was adding a csv_save spot by coding csv_save into fileio.pv. I then imported the csv_save into my app.py through the (from qualifier.utils.fileio import save_csv) line of code. All of this will allow the user to save and see their data upon using the code.

The next change was to add confirmation in regards to whether or not the user would like to save their qualifying loan, that is if they had any at all. The code would check for qualifying loans and if none are located the system will then exit. If qualifying loans are found the system will then ask the user if they would like their data saved and where. You would then specify your location and move forward.
